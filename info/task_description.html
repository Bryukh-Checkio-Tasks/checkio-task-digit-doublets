            ...'And as for YOU,' she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen, whom
            she considered as the cause of all the mischief--but the Queen was no
            longer at her side--she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a
            little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round
            after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her.

            At any other time, Alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was
            far too much excited to be surprised at anything NOW. 'As for YOU,'
            she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of
            jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, 'I'll shake
            you into a kitten, that I will!'

            She took her off the table as she spoke, and shook her backwards and
            forwards with all her might.

            The Red Queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very
            small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as Alice went on
            shaking her, she kept on growing shorter--and fatter--and softer--and
            rounder--and--

    Doublets (also known as Word ladder) is a word game invented by Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll).
    A doublets puzzle begins with two words, and to solve the puzzle one must find a chain of other words to link the two,
    in which two adjacent words (that is, words in successive steps) differ by one letter.
</p>

<p>
    For Example: <strong>FLOOR</strong>&nbsp;&rArr; FLOOR&nbsp;&rArr; FLOOD&nbsp;&rArr; BLOOD&nbsp;&rArr;
    BROOD&nbsp;&rArr; BROAD&nbsp;&rArr; <strong>BREAD</strong>
</p>

<p>
    But our Robots like digits more than letters, thus we changed the rules little.
    You are given the list of numbers the same length and
    to solve the puzzle you should find the shortest chain of numbers (from given list)
    to link the first number with the last in which two adjacent numbers differ by one digit.
</p>

<p>
    For Example. There is a list [123, 991, 323, 321, 329, 121, 921, 125, 999].
    The shortest way from the first to the last is:
    <strong>123</strong>&nbsp;&rArr; 121&nbsp;&rArr; 921&nbsp;&rArr; 991&nbsp;&rArr; <strong>999</strong>
</p>

<p>You should write a function that receive a list of numbers (positive integers) and
    returns the shortest route as a list of numbers.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A list of numbers with the same length.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The shortest chain from the first to the last number, as a list of integers.

checkio([456, 455, 454, 356, 656, 654]) == [456, 454, 654]  # or [456, 656, 654]
