            she considered as the cause of all the mischief--but the Queen was no
            longer at her side--she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a

            The Red Queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very
            small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as Alice went on
            shaking her, she kept on growing shorter--and fatter--and softer--and
